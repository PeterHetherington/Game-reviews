Requirements met:
🎯 Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
🎯 Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either media queries or responsive CSS styling.
🎯 Create a working GET API route in your server.
🎯 Create a working POST API route in your client.
🎯 Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

Stretch Requirements met:
🏹 Provide additional functionality on the form, for example, by adding form validation or other options.
🏹 Style the page excellently, for example, by adding extra UX considerations or animations.
🏹 Create an option for users to like others’ posts.

 Issues:
 - form validation is weak, ideally I would have made sure users could only review games from a populated game database to avoid spelling mistakes for easier filtering. I would have also liked to implement a login/account creation to discourage fake/problematic reviews or names.
 - Given more time I would have liked to implement filters to allow users to search for reviews by game titles
